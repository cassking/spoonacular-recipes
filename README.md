#To run locally
`yarn`
`bundle install`
make sure you have `foreman` installed
( yeah just discovered the magic of foreman and a Procfile combo!)
(`gem install foreman`) https://github.com/ddollar/foreman
`foreman start -f Procfile.dev -p 3000`
(this will start both you rails and your webpack servers all at once)
